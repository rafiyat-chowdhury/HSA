                <h2>The Sanda Way</h2>
                    <p>If you are serious to develop yourself as a fighter, serious to develop yourself so that you can thrive in a self defense situation then look no further. I want the best for my students. I want them to be stronger than before, more confident, to develop skills and discipline and to be able to protect themselves and their loved one. Your probably reading countless articles online to find which martials is best right? Well its all wrong. Lessons taught from Bruce Lee decades back should have taught us that even he knew Wing Chun was effective but there were aspects in the combat system which were lacking. But this didnt necessarily make it ineffective. What it comes down to is the mindset of the fighter, the skills, the strength which decides on who will be the victor. You need to constantly put yourself in through discomfort and hardship to grow as a fighter and as a person.</p>

                    <p>Sanda, also known as Sanshou or Chinese kickboxing, is a Chinese martial art and combat sport that combines techniques from traditional Chinese martial arts, modern combat sports, and military hand-to-hand combat.</p>

                    <p>Sanda involves striking techniques such as punches, kicks, and knee strikes, as well as wrestling, throwing, joint locks, clinching and grappling techniques.  It also incorporates the use of protective gear, including gloves and headgear, and follows rules and regulations for safety during competition.</p>
                    <p>Sanda training can also help develop important skills for self-defense, such as situational awareness, confidence, and mental resilience.</p>
